## About this Model

The _Tensor Model_ is designed to allow for the explicit simulation of organic electrochemical transistors. As a coarse-grained approach, it may offer to bridge the gap between small scale, quantum mechanical and device-scale simulation tools. It relies intrinsically on the tensor data archiecture, offering obvious advantages with respect to software and hardware enhancements.
