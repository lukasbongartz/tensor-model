## Introduction

The _Tensor Model_ is designed to allow for the explicit simulation of organic electrochemical transistors. As a coarse-grained approach, it may offer to bridge the gap between small scale, quantum mechanical and device-scale simulation tools. It relies intrinsically on the tensor data archiecture, offering obvious advantages with respect to software and hardware enhancements. 

### Organic Electrochemical Transistors

Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is a somewhat unique type of transistor device that does not rely on classical, inorganic semiconductors such as silicon, but that uses semiconducting polymers of both electronic and ionic conductivity. It was already developed in the 1980s, but only in recent times attracked broader academic interest for its potential in bioelectronics and neuromorphic computing. 
OECTs operate by translating ionic into electronic signals, which in the tech-tree, places them uniquely in-between the bio-logical, ion-based and the techno-logical, electron-based world. Given their organic and soft nature, OECTs integrate well with biological matter, which makes them appealing for neural interfaces. Given their electronic-ionic integration, OECTs also allow to _emulate_ the dynamics of biological neurons, which makes them appealing for brain-inspired, neuromorphic computing.
